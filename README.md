I've developed a Password Manager Application leveraging SwiftUI to ensure a streamlined and user-friendly experience.
To ensure security, the app requires authentication upon entry, using a **PIN (1234)**.

Within the app, users can conveniently add, edit, and update their password information, including domain names and associated email IDs.
The application is designed to prevent duplicate entries for domains to maintain organized and unique records. 
If a user attempts to enter a duplicate domain, an alert is generated, prompting them to modify the domain name, ensuring data integrity.

The application architecture is based on the MVVM pattern, promoting clean and maintainable code.
This structure not only simplifies the development process but also enhances the overall readability and scalability of the application.

Additionally, the app utilizes reusable views to streamline development and ensure a consistent user interface.

Overall, this compact application is an effective tool for managing password data securely and efficiently, 
with an emphasis on user experience and code quality.
